## An Audio memory game ##

Welcome Foolish Mortals is an audio visual Memory game inspired by the popular Disney theme park attraction, [The Haunted Mansion](https://www.disneyworld.eu/attractions/magic-kingdom/haunted-mansion/). 

The target audience for this game is Disney fans, particularly fans of The Haunted Mansion, and fans of memory games.  As the ride can be a little spooky, some of the sounds and images in the game may spook younger players so it is recommended for ages 8+.

### UX ##

#### Colors ####

The Haunted Mansion has a clear, easily identifiable color palette. 

![IMAGE OF COLOR PALETTE](/assets/images/readme/disneyhauntedmansioncolorhex.png)

The background color for the header, footer and sidebar tie in with the background. 

The color of the text stands out against the background.

The colors of the boxes are the most identifiable colors from the attractions theming.

Many thanks to [color-hex.com](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/93407) and user [Lazaefair](https://www.color-hex.com/member/lazaefair) for help with sourcing the color palette.

#### Backgrounds ####
The Home screen background image is of the outside of the Haunted Mansion attraction inviting players in to the game.
The Background of the game is of the iconic Haunted Mansion wallpaper.
 
#### Audio files ####
The notes used in the gameplay are taken from the attractions soundtrack - Grim Grinning Ghosts.  These are A, E, D# and B and were created at home using [Sibelus](http://www.sibelius.com/download/index.html).

### Wireframes ###

The Wireframes for this project were created during the planning and design phase using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

Some of the features shown in the wireframes, such as the avatar selection and dashboard, have not been included in this version of the game due to time contraints, but are features that will be implemented in the future.  Please see Future Features for more details.

### Features ###

#### Existing Features ####

**Home page** 

When the Home page loads the player is given a simplified version of the rules and is prompted to 'Enter' the mansion.

The Home page will not feature a logo as the games name is prominently featured in the opening text.

The navigation bar will be visible so players can choose to read a more detailed version of the rules.

**Footer tab**

The footer will feature copyright information and links to The Walt Disney Company and Haunted mansion pages.

**Gameplay pages**

Header and Navigation Bar

Returning to traditional website design the top left of the page will feature a logo which links to the Home page.

The right of the page will feature a navigation bar of easily identifiable icons.

- The Home icon - Allows the player to navigate back to the Home page.
- The Questionmark icon - Allows the player to re-read the rules of the game.
- The Speaker icon - Allows the player to mute and unmute the games sound.

**Game board**

The background of the game board is the classic wallpaper of The Haunted Mansion.

The four buttons for the game are each colored to the attractions color scheme.
Each button will feature a slight box shadow to give the impression of elevation from the background.

During the computers turn and when on the players click each button will change transparency to make the button appear to light up.  This clearly shows the player where they are clicking and allows the player to play with sound muted if preferred. 


**Turns counter**

The turns Counter allows the user to keep track on how they are progressing through that difficulty level.  

The game does not end when they reach the required number of turns to complete the level.  It continues allowing the player to try and also beat their highest score!

**High Score modal**

The high score modal features fun text inspired by the script from the attraction.

It clearly shows the user their turn and the highest score from that device and encourages the user to play again.


### Future Features ###

- Being able to select the speed difficulty level you begin on so you don't always have to start from easy mode if you have completed the game a few times.

- Player being able to create an account to log username, chosen avatar and Highest Score so multiple players can play on the one device

The initial avatar images I had thought of are the four infamous stretching room paintings and will appeal to any fan of the attraction.

![IMAGE OF STRETCH ROOM PORTRAITS](/assets/images/readme/stretchroomportraits.png)

- Unlock rewards for e.g after specific highest scores or game played 5, 10, 15 times the reward could be 
 - play as other characters like the hitchhiking ghosts.
 - additional music e.g. winning and losing music.

### Features Left to Implement ###

- Avatar selection.

- Username input.

- Dashboard to left of game storing:
1. Username
2. Avatar
3. Difficulty Level
4. Highest Score

TESTING PLAYER AND DEVELOPER GOALS FROM UX SECTION

Players requirements:

- A game that is fun and exciting to play.
  - With the game increasing in speed rather than the user haveing a set number of turns to complete the user is kept on their toes and in jeapordy as the difficulty increases over time.
- Easy to use controls on all devices.
  - The buttons which help navigate around the website clearly show their use whilst the game buttons (teal, white, purple and grey) are large for frantic gameplay.
- Have clear rules for the game for those that need them.
  - A rough guide to the rules is visible on the Home page, anyone who needs a refresher or is unclear on the rules is able to find more information in the ? icon's modal available from the navbar on both the home and game pages.
- Have clear audio and visual cues which show where I have clicked.
  - To stay with the themeing of the site when a game button is clicked the opacity will change to a ghostly 0.5, this is accompanied by the corresponding audio.
- Be able to play with and without audio.
  - The player has the option to toggle between the audio being muted and on - this is clearly displayed in the navbar by easily recognisable icons.
- Get clear feedback on the number of turns the player is on.
  - A turn counter has been implemented so the player can keep track of what turn they are on.
- Get clear feedback on the users Highest Score.
  - When the user fails a modal is displayed to show them their highest score vs the turn they are currently on.
- Be able to choose my difficulty level.
  - The user is not yet able to choose the difficulty level they begin on, however they have clear feedback throughout the game on the difficulty level that they have currently progressed to.
- Visually rewarding images themed around The Haunted Mansion.
  - The background images and themeing are all centered around the attraction.  Super fans will recognise everything down to the haunting organ notes used for the game play audio (and if you're really lucky the sequence plays in the order that you get the theme!)

FURTHER TESTING

I invited friends and family to view the site on their devices and report any issues they find. Devices used included:

- MacBook
- MacBook Air
- MacBook Pro
- iPad
- iPad Pro
- Samsung S20
- Samsung J6
- iPhone 6S
- iPhone XR
- iPhone SE
- Pocophone F1 Mio
- Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite

Reported bugs/glitches included:

Mobile phones: audio - a lag is sometimes apparent, I believe this is more prominent on Apple devices. Noone reported that this negatively affected their gameplay experience however in future I would like to investigate this and implement a fix.  Initial searches suggest that using a library such as Howler.js may help.

Highscore modal: 'x' button - Not closing the modal.  Class checked and renamed to enable responsiveness.







### Bugs ###

- Linking audio files to buttons - initially when I added my audio to the html document when the JavaScript file was not able to set the audio to play without using visible audio controls which would not provide good UX for the game. 

  - *Solved* - I researched and discovered that often there can be an issue with playing audio when using iOS (I use a Mac) To solve this I moved the audio from index.html to the JavaScript file and placed each audio file in a variable.  When this variable is called in it's own function and attached to the .play() method it works nicely.

- The audio was not playing consistently if the suquence required repetition of notes, e.g. if the sequence was 1, 1, 1 the audio would only trigger play, mute, play.  

  - *Solved* - To make sure each note is played I shortened the length of the audio in each file to allow for retrigger time between notes.

- Pressing the reset button was causing a new sequence to trigger on to of the existing sequence so you would have 2 sequences playing on top of one another.  

  - *Solved* - On reset button click all sequences are cleared and the start button is displayed to prompt the player to manually restart the game.  The start button begins the game again and makes sure that the game is fully reset.

- When implementing increasing speed the speed jump wasn't happening when requested e.g I was asking after test turns 3, 6 and 9 yet the speed jump was happening at turns 5, 7 and 11.

  - *Solved* - Initially I had the function which controls the speed increase (checkForLevelIncrement()) set to pass in the flashCounter variable, using the flashCounter and calling the function where the flashCounter incremented during the computer play.  As I actually wanted the speed to increase with the turn counter I changed the variable passed in to checkForLevelIncrement() to turn and moved where this was called to after the turn is incremented as part of the checkAnswer() function.  This made the speed increase as expected.  I also checked and ensured that all statements in checkForLevelIncrement() were always going to be true.
